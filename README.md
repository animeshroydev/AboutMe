AboutMe
============================

Finished code for Android Kotlin Fundamentals codelab(Lesson 2: Layouts)

Introduction
------------

In the AboutMe app, you can showcase interesting facts about yourself, 
or you can customize the app for a friend, family member, or pet. 
The app displays a name, a DONE button, a star image, and some scrollable text.

Things Learned
-------------

Things that I learned from this App:
- Add views using the layout editor
- Extract the style of view in style.xml
- Add scroll view
- Add image view
- Add click listener
- Style button
- Use data binding to eliminate findViewById()
- Use data binding to display data
